# Voter Unions - Civic Engagement Platform

## Overview
Voter Unions is a cross-platform mobile application built with Expo and Supabase, designed to empower communities through political engagement, structured policy debates, and collective action. It connects online discussions with real-world political impact, enabling working-class voters to organize, coordinate vote pledging, track campaign progress, and participate in democratic decision-making. Key capabilities include union management, enhanced debate systems, transparency tools (Power Tracker), collaborative policy drafting (People's Agenda, People's Terms), and specialized organizing platforms for consumers and workers (Consumer Union, Workers Union). The platform also provides educational content on corporate and labor power dynamics. The project aims to foster collective action and increase political efficacy among its users.

## User Preferences
- Expo Go compatibility enforced (no custom native modules)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Offline-first architecture
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
- Follow all rules below while building this app. The app MUST run in Expo Go during development and build reliably with EAS Build for both iOS and Android later.
- Only use Expo-supported packages (expo-notifications, expo-secure-store, expo-file-system, expo-sharing, expo-haptics, expo-image, expo-blur, expo-clipboard).
- Forbidden while in Expo Go: any third-party module that requires npx expo prebuild or custom native code.
- Media, camera, and file features must use Expo equivalents (expo-camera, expo-image-picker, expo-file-system).
- Do not modify android/ or ios/ folders unless we intentionally prebuild.
- Before adding any library, explain:
  1. Why it's needed
  2. Expo Go compatibility
  3. Impact on EAS build
  4. Removal plan if deprecated

## System Architecture
The application is built using Expo SDK 52 with React Native and TypeScript, ensuring a managed Expo workflow. Navigation is handled by React Navigation, using bottom tabs for primary features and stack navigators for detailed content. State management combines React Query for server state and React Context API for authentication. The backend leverages Supabase for PostgreSQL, Realtime features, and Storage. Security is paramount, employing `expo-secure-store` for token storage and comprehensive Row-Level Security (RLS) policies. An offline-first approach is implemented using React Query.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Standard mobile UI patterns with bottom tab navigation for primary features.
- Material Top Tabs are used for sub-navigation within complex sections (e.g., Power Tracker, People's Agenda).

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Authentication**: Email/password authentication with verification, hardware-backed token storage (`expo-secure-store`), auto-token refresh, password reset, and session management via React Context API. Features include strong password policies, email validation, audit logging, client-side rate limiting, multi-device session tracking, and remote session revocation. A robust email verification system is enforced for critical actions.
- **Core Modules**: User profiles, union management with role-based access control, an enhanced debate system with real-time tallies, and a social feed.
- **Civic Engagement Platforms**:
  - **Power Tracker**: Tracks political influence with user-generated data.
  - **People's Agenda**: Facilitates collaborative policy drafting.
  - **People's Terms / Negotiations**: Formalizes community consensus and tracks negotiation outcomes.
  - **Consumer Union & Workers Union**: Organize collective actions (boycotts, strikes) with democratic voting and robust vote field protection via database triggers and RLS.
- **Educational Platforms**: "Corporate Power" and "Labor Power" sections provide user-generated content on power dynamics.
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL with UUID v4 primary keys, soft deletes, comprehensive RLS, automatic counts via triggers, and performance-optimized indexes.
- **Device-Based Vote Protection**: Enforces one vote per entity per device using `device_id` and `expo-secure-store`.
- **XSS Protection System**: Automated enforcement via AST-based data flow analysis with Babel parser, sanitizing all user-generated content and validated by 62 automated tests. ESLint provides additional static analysis.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Includes a comprehensive content reporting system, GDPR-compliant privacy policy, data export (Article 20), and a robust hard delete account system (Article 17) with immediate cascade deletion, automated backend cleanup, and status tracking.
- **Admin Audit Logging & Transparency**: Comprehensive audit logs track authentication, moderation, and admin actions. Database triggers log report status changes and content deletions, with RLS allowing union members to view moderation logs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting prevents abuse across 11 action types.
- **Blue Spirit Phase 1 Migration**: In progress, transitioning from Supabase email/password authentication to a WebAuthn-based, privacy-first architecture. This involves removing email collection, implementing a zero-knowledge architecture, blind-signature voting, E2EE messaging, and encrypted memberships. The migration utilizes feature flags, a data adapter layer, and security guardrails. An alternative "Device Token Auth" path for Expo Go compatibility has been identified.

  - ‚úÖ Created metro.config.js with resolver configuration
  - ‚úÖ Updated code for v1.x API (`randomPrivateKey()`, `.toCompactRawBytes()`)
  - ‚úÖ Applied same fixes to backend for consistency
- **Security:** No downgrade - v1.x uses same P-256 curve, RFC 6979, and cryptographic primitives
- **Status:** ‚úÖ All LSP errors resolved, ready for Expo Go testing
