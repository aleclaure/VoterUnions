‚ö°Ô∏è Purpose-Driven Build Prompt: Voter Unions App

üß≠ Overview

Build a cross-platform civic engagement app using JavaScript with Expo that can be deployed to iOS and Android through Expo‚Äôs managed workflow.
Use Supabase as the backend for authentication, real-time data, storage, and analytics.

The goal is to create a Voter Unions Platform ‚Äî a digital space where communities organize politically around shared values.
The experience should combine the discussion depth of Reddit with the team coordination of Discord, all centered on grassroots democracy, debate, and collective action.

üèõ Core Systems & Features

1. Union Pages
	‚Ä¢	Serve as community hubs for local or issue-based voter unions.
	‚Ä¢	Contain:
	‚Ä¢	Public Feeds for open updates, statements, and campaigns.
	‚Ä¢	Private Channels for internal organizing, voting prep, and messaging.
	‚Ä¢	Role Management: define access levels such as admin, delegate, member, and observer.
	‚Ä¢	Each union maintains its own identity, member count, and verified voter list (stored securely in Supabase).

2. Debate Section
	‚Ä¢	Structured space for policy debates and deliberation.
	‚Ä¢	Include:
	‚Ä¢	Argument threads tagged by issue area (e.g., Housing, Climate, Labor Rights).
	‚Ä¢	Voting, reply chains, and reaction metrics (agree/disagree/neutral).
	‚Ä¢	Visibility filters (most active, most persuasive, latest).
	‚Ä¢	Encourage evidence-based, respectful debate as the foundation for group decisions.

3. Voting & Pledging System
	‚Ä¢	Let each union coordinate real-world influence:
	‚Ä¢	Pledge votes for candidates who align with chosen policies.
	‚Ä¢	Flag opposing candidates or policies that conflict with union goals.
	‚Ä¢	Show a ‚Äúrepresentation dashboard‚Äù visualizing:
	‚Ä¢	% of members pledged,
	‚Ä¢	policies supported,
	‚Ä¢	and total voter power represented.
	‚Ä¢	Serve as a bridge between online consensus and real political outcomes.

4. Progress & Collaboration Tools
	‚Ä¢	Track progress of collective campaigns:
	‚Ä¢	Milestone dashboard for petitions, outreach, or legislative goals.
	‚Ä¢	Collaborative drafting tools (built via Supabase storage and JavaScript editors) for creating public position statements.
	‚Ä¢	Send finalized documents as official policy stances from the union to candidates or offices.
	‚Ä¢	Encourage transparency, accountability, and steady progress toward real outcomes.

üåç Mission & Vision

This app exists to transform online discussion into real-world action.
Its purpose is to help working-class voters organize intelligently and collectively, forming voter unions that:
	‚Ä¢	debate ideas, not identities,
	‚Ä¢	coordinate votes instead of fragmenting them, and
	‚Ä¢	fight systemic corruption, not one another.

The platform promotes unity, transparency, and empowerment ‚Äî turning civic frustration into organized democratic power.

üî© Technical Intent (For AI Agents or Developers)

When implementing, prioritize:
	‚Ä¢	Expo Go compatibility first, then prepare for EAS iOS/Android builds.
	‚Ä¢	Supabase handles: auth, storage, realtime sync, and role-based access.
	‚Ä¢	Structure code modularly: UnionPage.js, DebatePage.js, VotePage.js, ProgressDashboard.js.
	‚Ä¢	Use a scalable design system and shared component library to maintain visual consistency.
	‚Ä¢	Keep architecture lightweight, offline-capable, and fast ‚Äî designed for civic usability and reliability under network stress.
