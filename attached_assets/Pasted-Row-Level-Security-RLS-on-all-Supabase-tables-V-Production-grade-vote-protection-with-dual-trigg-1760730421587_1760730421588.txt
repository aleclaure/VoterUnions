Row-Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables
• V Production-grade vote protection with dual triggers (prevents vote manipulation)
• V Secure token storage with expo-secure-store
• V Soft deletes (data recovery possible)
• V Email verification for accounts 
Highest Level Security Would Include:
1. Authentication & Identity
• Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - Essential for political organizing
• Passwordless auth options - WebAuthn/biometrics for mobile
• Account activity monitoring - Detect suspicious logins
• Rate limiting on auth endpoints - Prevent brute force attacks
2. Data Privacy & Encryption
• End-to-end encryption for sensitive messages/debates
• Encrypted user profiles - Political affiliations are sensitive data
• Zero-knowledge architecture where possible
• Data anonymization for analytics

3. Vote & Action Integrity
• V You already have trigger-based vote protection (excellent!)
• Cryptographic vote receipts - Users verify their vote counted
• Audit logs - Track all vote changes with timestamps
• IP/device fingerprinting - Detect duplicate voting attempts
4. Content Security
• Content signing - Verify reports haven't been tampered with
• Source verification - Links to evidence must be validated
• Spam/bot detection - Prevent coordinated manipulation
• Moderation queue with transparency

Potential Vulnerabilities to Address:
Critical:
1. No rate limiting - Currently vulnerable to:
• Spam report creation
• Vote flooding attempts
• DDoS on endpoints
2. No account verification beyond email - Risk of:
• Bot/fake accounts in unions
• Coordinated manipulation campaigns
• Astroturfing (fake grassroots movements)
3. Client-side vote counting - If any vote tallies happen client-side:
• Could be manipulated before reaching server
• Should always be server-side aggregation only
4. No session timeout/rotation - Long-lived tokens risk:
• Token theft and reuse
• Compromised devices staying logged in

Important:
5. Public read access - Anyone can see:
• Union membership lists
• Who voted on what (it tracked)
• Political positions/activity
• Consider privacy controls per user
6. No audit trail - Currently can't detect:
• When/how data was modified
• Who accessed sensitive information
• Coordinated attack patterns
7. No input sanitization verification - Risk of:
• SQL injection (Supabase helps but verify)
• XSS attacks via user content
• Malicious links in evidence fields
8. File upload vulnerabilities if/when you add):
• Malware in user uploads
• Phishing documents
• Steganography (hidden messages)

Moderate:
9. No CAPTCHA/human verification - Bots can:
• Auto-create accounts
• Spam proposals/ reports
• Manipulate vote counts
0. Soft deletes visible in queries - If deleted_at IS NULL filters aren't perfect:
• "Deleted" data might leak
• Privacy violations possible
1. No geographic verification - For local organizing:
• Can't verify users are actually local
• Outsiders could manipulate local unions

Specific Risks for Political Apps:
1. State-level attacks - Governments may target civic apps
2. Coordinated disinformation - Bad actors spreading false info
3. Union infiltration - Opponents joining to disrupt
4. Doxxing risks - User identities/addresses leaked
5. Legal compliance - Election law varies by jurisdiction
