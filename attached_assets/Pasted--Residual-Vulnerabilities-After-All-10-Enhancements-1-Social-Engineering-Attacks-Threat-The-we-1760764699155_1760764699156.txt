üîì Residual Vulnerabilities After All 10 Enhancements
1. Social Engineering Attacks
Threat: The weakest link is always humans, not technology.

Attack Vectors:

Phishing emails pretending to be from union leaders
Fake "verification" requests to steal credentials
Impersonation of organizers to manipulate members
Phone calls pretending to be support staff
Why tech can't fix it: MFA helps, but if someone convinces a user to hand over their TOTP code, they're in.

Mitigation: User education, security awareness training

2. Insider Threats
Threat: Malicious union admins or moderators.

Attack Vectors:

Admin exports all member data and leaks it
Moderator deletes critical organizing content
Infiltrator joins as admin, sabotages campaigns
Admin shares internal strategy with opposition
Why tech can't fix it: Admins NEED access to do their job. You can't fully lock them out.

Mitigation: Audit logs help (you have this), but damage can still occur before detection.

3. Supply Chain Attacks
Threat: Compromised npm packages or third-party services.

Attack Vectors:

Malicious code in react-native-x library
Supabase itself gets breached
Expo servers compromised
hCaptcha service collects data maliciously
Why tech can't fix it: You depend on hundreds of external packages. Any could be compromised.

Mitigation: Dependency scanning (Snyk, Dependabot), regular audits, but can't prevent zero-days.

4. Physical Device Compromise
Threat: Lost, stolen, or confiscated phones.

Attack Vectors:

Police seize organizer's phone during protest
Stolen phone at rally with app logged in
Employer conf

Decided on explaining data exposure
Great question - supply chain attacks are terrifying for political organizing apps because they bypass ALL your security. Let me break down what could be compromised:

üéØ Supply Chain Attack: What User Data Gets Exposed
Scenario: Malicious npm Package
Let's say a popular package like react-native-pager-view (which you're using) gets hijacked:

Level 1: Everything in the App üî¥
The malicious code runs inside your app with full access to:

Authentication Tokens

Supabase JWT tokens (stored in expo-secure-store)
Session data
Impact: Attacker can impersonate ANY user, access their account
User Input in Real-Time

Every keystroke as users type passwords
Private debate messages before encryption
Proposal text before sanitization
Impact: Attacker sees everything users do
Local App State

Current user profile (name, email, union memberships)
Vote history cached locally
Draft proposals not yet submitted
Impact: Full visibility into user activity
Device Information

Device ID (your vote tracking system!)
IP address
Location data
Impact: Can track individual organizers physically
Scenario: Supabase Breach
If Supabase itself gets compromised:

Level 2: Entire Database üî¥üî¥
Attacker gets everything in your PostgreSQL database:

Identity Data

All emails (including unverified claurealex@gmail.com)
Hashed passwords (bcrypt, but still a risk)
Phone numbers (if you add SMS verification)
Real names vs pseudonyms
Political Activity

Every union membership
Every vote on every proposal
Every debate comment ever made
Every politician tracked
Every boycott/strike proposal created
Organizing Intelligence

Which unions are most active
Which campaigns are close to activation (e.g., 98% to boycott threshold)
Internal strategy discussions
Negotiation terms and demands
Relationships & Networks

Who votes with whom (organizing networks)
Union admin hierarchies
Cross-union collaboration patterns
Audit Trails

Login times and patterns
Device fingerprints
Geolocation data (city/country from IP)
Moderation actions
Scenario: Expo Build Servers Compromised
If Expo's infrastructure is hacked:

Level 3: Code Injection üî¥üî¥üî¥
Attacker could:

Backdoor Your App Builds

Inject keylogger into production iOS/Android builds
Add code to exfiltrate data silently
Users download "official" app from App Store with malware
Steal Build Secrets

Your EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Database credentials
API keys for third-party services
Long-Term Surveillance

Malicious code persists across updates
Hard to detect (looks like legitimate app)
üìä Data Exposure Summary
Attack Type	Data Compromised	Impact
Malicious npm package	Tokens, keystrokes, local state	Every user's account compromised
Supabase breach	Entire database	Complete organizing intelligence exposed
Expo build compromise	All builds + secrets	Long-term surveillance of all users
üéØ Real-World Consequences for Your App
If Supply Chain Attack Happens:
Organizers Doxxed

Full list of union members leaked to employers
Names, emails, voting patterns public
Could result in mass firings
Campaigns Sabotaged

Attackers see boycott campaigns at 98% threshold
Can create fake accounts to vote "No" and kill momentum
Or leak strategy to targeted companies
Government Surveillance

Police/intelligence agencies buy leaked data
Track protest organizers via device IDs
Use geolocation to identify activists
Chilling Effect

Users stop organizing once breach is public
Trust in platform destroyed
Movement loses critical tool
üõ°Ô∏è What Makes This Scary
Even with all 10 security enhancements:

‚úÖ MFA doesn't help (malware steals tokens AFTER login)
‚úÖ E2E encryption doesn't help (malware sees plaintext before encryption)
‚úÖ Privacy controls don't help (attacker has database access)
‚úÖ Rate limiting doesn't help (not an API attack)
You'd need:

Runtime application self-protection (RASP)
Code signing verification
Supply chain security audits (expensive!)
Self-hosted infrastructure (bye Supabase/Expo)
ü§î Bottom Line
Supply chain attacks are the nuclear option. They bypass all your app-level security because the attacker IS your app.

Mitigation strategies:

Dependency pinning - Lock to specific versions, audit before upgrading
Subresource Integrity - Verify package checksums
Bug bounty program - Pay hackers to find issues first
Incident response plan - How to notify users if breach happens
Zero-trust architecture - Assume any service could be compromised
But realistically: You're trusting Expo, Supabase, and 50+ npm packages. If any get pwned, you're toast. That's the trade-off for not running your own infrastructure.
