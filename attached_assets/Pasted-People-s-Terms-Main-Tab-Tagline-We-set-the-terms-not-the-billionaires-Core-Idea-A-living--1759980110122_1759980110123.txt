People’s Terms (Main Tab)

Tagline: “We set the terms — not the billionaires.”
Core Idea: A living, evolving people’s contract — where everyone can propose, refine, vote, and activate shared demands.

📝 1. Proposals

Purpose: The drafting floor.
Functionality:
	•	Users submit new demands in clear language (title + description + category + optional data or sources).
	•	Submissions display user handle, date, and supporting sources (articles, reports, etc.).
	•	Community comments and suggestions appear below each draft.
	•	Users can “endorse,” “revise,” or “merge” proposals that overlap.
	•	Moderators (or union admins) can group related ones into issue clusters (e.g., “Housing,” “Healthcare”).

Goal: Turn raw public sentiment into organized, debate-ready ideas.
Example: “Cap insulin prices at $25” → tagged under “Healthcare Costs.”

🗳️ 2. Voting Hall

Purpose: The decision engine.
Functionality:
	•	Displays all approved proposals awaiting community vote.
	•	Each proposal shows:
	•	Current support percentage
	•	Total votes and demographics (optional region, union, etc.)
	•	Countdown timer until voting closes
	•	Voting system options:
	•	👍 Support / 👎 Oppose
	•	or weighted voting (1–5 importance rating)
	•	Thresholds automatically mark when an idea passes (e.g., 65%+ support → “Ratified”).

Goal: Make every user feel they directly shape the collective agenda.
Tagline: “Every vote defines our demands.”

📈 3. Ratified Terms

Purpose: The living document — The People’s Platform.
Functionality:
	•	Displays all passed demands with tags (Housing, Labor, Environment, etc.).
	•	Shows metrics:
	•	Support percentage
	•	Number of unions endorsing
	•	Linked negotiations that use it as leverage
	•	Users can comment, suggest language improvements, or propose follow-up goals (e.g., enforcement steps).
	•	Option to “watch” a term for updates in negotiations.

Goal: Turn people’s consensus into an official, evolving document of demands.
Tagline: “Our values, in writing.”

🔥 4. Activated Demands

Purpose: Where ideals become leverage.
Functionality:
	•	Shows which ratified demands are now active negotiations in progress (linked to the Negotiations tab).
	•	Example:
	•	“Raise the minimum wage to $15” → Active against Senator X → 52,000 pledges.
	•	“Ban corporate dark money” → Active against Company Y → 14,000 pledges.
	•	Track real-time outcomes:
	•	✅ “Bill introduced”
	•	🚫 “Voted down”
	•	🔄 “Under review”
	•	Notifications when progress occurs: “Your activated demand is being debated in Congress.”

Goal: Close the loop — showing users that their votes lead to pressure and results.
Tagline: “From principle to power.”
