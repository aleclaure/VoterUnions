🗳 Voter Unions App — Union Tab Redesign (Final Functional Specification)

1. Overview

The “Unions” section of the app should be redesigned with three main subtabs, accessible through a top banner navigation bar:
	1.	All Posts — global feed from all unions and their channels.
	2.	My Unions — user’s personal hub for unions they’ve created or joined, including a channel-based post system.
	3.	Discover — explore and filter unions by social or political issue areas.

Each subtab should be fully interactive, data-synced, and optimized for navigation without page reloads.

2. Subtab 1: All Posts (Global Feed)

Purpose: Display all public posts from every union and channel in one unified feed.

Functional details:
	•	Show all public posts across all unions and channels.
	•	Include filters for organizing content:
	•	Sort by most upvotes → least upvotes.
	•	Sort by most comments → least comments.
	•	Filter by recency: Today, This Week, This Month.
	•	Filter by shared channel hashtags across unions (e.g., #climate, #healthcare).
	•	Clicking on a post takes the user to its original union and channel.
	•	Fetches posts automatically from the My Unions and public unions databases.

3. Subtab 2: My Unions (User Hub & Channel System)

Purpose: Allow users to create, manage, and interact with unions and their channels — similar to a Discord-style layout.

A. Layout Structure

This subtab should include two stacked banners at the top:
	1.	Union Selection Banner (Topmost)
	•	Shows all unions the user has joined or created.
	•	Allows users to switch between unions quickly.
	•	Includes a “Create Union” button.
	•	When a union is selected, it automatically loads its channels below in the second banner.
	2.	Channel Banner (Below Unions Banner)
	•	Displays a list of all channels within the selected union (e.g., #housing, #workers-rights).
	•	Includes a “Create Channel” button.
	•	The banner should minimize or collapse after the user selects a channel, to maximize screen space for posts.
	•	The channels should display as hashtag-style buttons (#channel-name) and be scrollable horizontally if there are many.

B. Channel Content and Posts
	•	Below the two banners, display all posts from all channels combined for the currently selected union (automatic aggregation).
	•	Include a “Create Post” button directly under the banners.
	•	When clicked, the user can:
	•	Write a post.
	•	Select one or multiple channels to publish the post to.
	•	Choose the destination channels from a hashtag selector banner that appears during post creation.
	•	After posting, the content appears under the corresponding channels and updates the “All Posts” global feed if marked public.

C. Channel Creation & Management
	•	The “Create Channel” button should open a small modal or input prompt where:
	•	The user sets the channel’s hashtag name (e.g., #immigration, #climate-action).
	•	The new channel appears in the channel banner immediately.
	•	Each channel has its own feed, but users can view all posts combined (default view).
	•	Channel visibility can be public or members-only.

4. Subtab 3: Discover (Union Exploration)

Purpose: Let users browse and join other unions by interest or issue.

Functional details:
	•	Display all available unions in a scrollable list or card grid.
	•	Each union card should include:
	•	Union name, description, number of members.
	•	Primary issue tags (e.g., #climate, #workers-rights).
	•	A “Join Union” button.
	•	Add filtering and search functionality:
	•	Filter unions by key topics:
	•	Climate Change
	•	Immigration Rights
	•	Healthcare
	•	Workers’ Rights
	•	Women’s Healthcare
	•	LGBTQ+ Rights
	•	Search by name, keywords, or location (optional future feature).

⸻

5. Data & Interaction Flow
	•	Posts from “My Unions” channels (when marked public) are automatically pulled into the “All Posts” tab feed.
	•	The “Discover” tab serves as the discovery and joining system — once a user joins a union, it appears in “My Unions.”
	•	Creating or joining a union dynamically updates all related data (unions banner, channel list, and posts) without reloading.
	•	Channels are linked via hashtags, allowing for easy cross-union filtering in the “All Posts” tab.
