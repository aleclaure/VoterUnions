# Railway Deployment Guide - Security Fixes

## Required Environment Variables for Production

Before deploying the security fixes to Railway, you **MUST** set the following environment variables. The service will **crash on startup** if these are not configured in production.

### 1. JWT Secrets (CRITICAL - NEW REQUIREMENT)

Add these two new environment variables to your Railway service:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=764c47922c729e652c7d7d63b66e1b9e50cbc6da6b8e0778c85bee5f36e0ce04
REFRESH_SECRET=cd9bae45355e877824074cf9df0f4cc15861700b67de616b8ea91526173aceff
```

**Why this is required:**
- Previous code had fallback secrets (`dev-secret-change-in-production`)
- Security audit identified this as CRITICAL vulnerability
- New code validates secrets in production and crashes if missing
- Prevents accidental deployment with weak default secrets

**Validation performed:**
- ✅ Must be set (no fallbacks in production)
- ✅ Must be at least 32 characters long
- ✅ Must not contain "dev-secret" substring
- ✅ Crashes with clear error if validation fails

### 2. CORS Origin (CRITICAL - NEW REQUIREMENT)

Add the CORS_ORIGIN environment variable with your frontend domains:

```bash
# For production (comma-separated, HTTPS required)
CORS_ORIGIN=https://voterunions.com,https://app.voterunions.com

# For staging/testing (optional, can include localhost)
CORS_ORIGIN=https://staging.voterunions.com,http://localhost:3000
```

**Why this is required:**
- Previous code allowed all origins (`*`) in production
- Security audit identified this as CRITICAL vulnerability
- New code requires explicit origin whitelist in production
- Prevents cross-origin attacks from unauthorized domains

**Validation performed:**
- ✅ Must be set in production
- ✅ Cannot be empty
- ✅ Must use HTTPS (except localhost)
- ✅ Supports comma-separated list
- ✅ Crashes with clear error if validation fails

### 3. Existing Environment Variables (Already Set)

These should already be configured in Railway:

```bash
# Database (already set)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Encryption (already set - from Week 1 Day 2)
AUDIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=fc2d86bff6e40f8661f6e76288b2d5755568edf422bd2f54e462b13416e646f9

# Node environment (already set)
NODE_ENV=production
```

## How to Set Environment Variables in Railway

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your project: `voter-unions`
3. Select your service: `auth-service`
4. Click **Variables** tab
5. Click **+ New Variable**
6. Add each variable:
   - Variable Name: `JWT_SECRET`
   - Variable Value: `764c47922c729e652c7d7d63b66e1b9e50cbc6da6b8e0778c85bee5f36e0ce04`
7. Click **+ New Variable** again
   - Variable Name: `REFRESH_SECRET`
   - Variable Value: `cd9bae45355e877824074cf9df0f4cc15861700b67de616b8ea91526173aceff`
8. Click **+ New Variable** again
   - Variable Name: `CORS_ORIGIN`
   - Variable Value: `https://voterunions.com,https://app.voterunions.com`
9. Click **Deploy** (or wait for auto-deploy after git push)

### Option 2: Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to project
railway link

# Set variables
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=764c47922c729e652c7d7d63b66e1b9e50cbc6da6b8e0778c85bee5f36e0ce04
railway variables set REFRESH_SECRET=cd9bae45355e877824074cf9df0f4cc15861700b67de616b8ea91526173aceff
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://voterunions.com,https://app.voterunions.com
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` in Railway
- [ ] Set `REFRESH_SECRET` in Railway
- [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGIN` in Railway with your frontend domains
- [ ] Verify `AUDIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is still set (from Day 2)
- [ ] Verify `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] Test locally in development mode (warnings should appear)

### During Deployment

- [ ] Commit security fixes to git
- [ ] Push to GitHub main branch
- [ ] Railway auto-deploys
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs for successful startup
- [ ] Check for "Server listening at..." message
- [ ] Verify no security validation errors

### After Deployment

- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-service.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Test device registration endpoint
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify audit logs still working
- [ ] Check Railway logs for any warnings

## What Happens After Deployment

### Expected Impact

1. **Active JWT tokens will be invalidated** (one-time impact)
   - Old tokens signed with old secrets won't verify
   - Users will need to re-authenticate
   - This is expected and acceptable

2. **CORS now restricted** (security improvement)
   - Only whitelisted domains can make requests
   - Unauthorized origins will be blocked
   - Frontend must match CORS_ORIGIN domains

3. **No impact on audit logs** (independent system)
   - Audit logging uses separate encryption key
   - Continues working normally
   - No data loss or corruption

### Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Revert git commits
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or revert to previous Railway deployment
# In Railway dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments tab
# 2. Find previous successful deployment
# 3. Click "Redeploy"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "CRITICAL SECURITY: JWT_SECRET and REFRESH_SECRET must be set"

**Cause:** JWT secrets not configured in Railway

**Fix:**
```bash
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=764c47922c729e652c7d7d63b66e1b9e50cbc6da6b8e0778c85bee5f36e0ce04
railway variables set REFRESH_SECRET=cd9bae45355e877824074cf9df0f4cc15861700b67de616b8ea91526173aceff
```

### Error: "CRITICAL SECURITY: CORS_ORIGIN must be set in production"

**Cause:** CORS origin not configured in Railway

**Fix:**
```bash
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://voterunions.com,https://app.voterunions.com
```

### Error: "Production CORS origins must use HTTPS"

**Cause:** CORS_ORIGIN contains HTTP URLs (not HTTPS)

**Fix:** Update CORS_ORIGIN to use HTTPS:
```bash
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://voterunions.com
```

### Warning: "Using default JWT secrets - NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION"

**Cause:** Running in development mode without JWT secrets

**Fix:** This is expected in development. Set JWT secrets in `.env` file or ignore warning.

### Users getting "Invalid token" errors after deployment

**Cause:** Old tokens signed with old secrets are now invalid

**Fix:** This is expected. Users need to re-authenticate. Inform users via email/notification if needed.

## Testing After Deployment

### 1. Health Check

```bash
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "auth",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T04:00:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 2. CORS Test

```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://voterunions.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://your-service.railway.app/auth/register-device
```

Should return CORS headers allowing the whitelisted origin.

### 3. Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# From backend/services/auth directory
export AUTH_SERVICE_URL="https://your-service.railway.app"
npm run test
```

All tests should pass.

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Monitor Railway logs for 24 hours
2. ✅ Verify frontend can still authenticate
3. ✅ Check audit logs are still being written
4. ✅ Update frontend CORS domains if needed
5. ✅ Consider adding rate limiting (SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT recommendation)
6. ✅ Consider adding request validation (SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT recommendation)
