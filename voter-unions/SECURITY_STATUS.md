   - Install: `npm install @hcaptcha/react-native-hcaptcha`
2. **Add CAPTCHA to Signup:**
   - Show hCaptcha modal before submitting signup form
   - Verify token server-side (Supabase Edge Function)
3. **Add CAPTCHA to High-Risk Votes:**
   - Only for votes on proposals above threshold (e.g., >1000 voters)
   - Prevents vote flooding on critical campaigns
4. **Supabase Edge Function:**
   ```typescript
   // verify-captcha.ts
   import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
   
   serve(async (req) => {
     const { token } = await req.json()
     const response = await fetch('https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
       body: `response=${token}&secret=${Deno.env.get('HCAPTCHA_SECRET')}`
     })
     const data = await response.json()
     return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: data.success }))
   })
   ```

**Testing:**
- Test on iOS and Android

**Why:** Political organizers may be monitored by employers or governments.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Hash IP Addresses Before Storage:**
   - Update `auditHelpers.ts` to hash IPs with salt
   - Store only hashed IP + city/country (not full address)
2. **Add Privacy Notice:**
   - Show warning on login if VPN not detected
   - "Your IP address is being logged for security. Consider using a VPN."
3. **Optional Location Tracking Disable:**
   - Add toggle in Privacy Settings
   - `disable_location_tracking` column in `user_privacy_settings`
   - Don't store IP/city/country if disabled
4. **Update Audit Logging:**
   ```typescript
   // Hash IP before storing
   const hashedIP = await hashString(ipAddress + SALT);
   const location = await getLocationFromIP(ipAddress); // Only city/country
   ```

**Testing:**
- Test IP hashing works correctly
- Test location tracking disable
- Test VPN detection (may not be reliable)

---

### 8. Self-Destructing/Ephemeral Content ‚ö™ NICE TO HAVE
**Priority:** Nice to Have | **Effort:** Medium | **Timeline:** 1 week

**Why:** Sensitive organizing discussions don't need to live forever.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Database Schema:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE debates ADD COLUMN auto_delete_after_days INTEGER;
   ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN expires_at TIMESTAMP;
   CREATE TABLE ephemeral_content_settings (

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Inherent Security Risks (Awareness Only - Lowest Priority)

These are **residual vulnerabilities** that persist even after implementing all 10 security enhancements above. They cannot be fully eliminated through code/infrastructure changes alone and require non-technical mitigation strategies.

---

### 11. Social Engineering Attacks üü£ AWARENESS ONLY
**Priority:** Awareness Only | **Cannot Be Fully Prevented**

**Why this persists:** Humans are the weakest link. Even with perfect security, attackers can manipulate users into giving up credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Phishing Emails** - Fake emails pretending to be from union leaders
   - "Click here to verify your account or we'll delete your membership"
   - "Urgent: Vote on this proposal now" with malicious links
2. **Fake Verification Requests** - Impersonators asking for TOTP codes
   - "Support needs your 2FA code to fix an issue"
3. **Organizer Impersonation** - Attackers pretending to be trusted members
   - Join union, build trust, then manipulate votes or leak strategy
4. **Phone-Based Attacks** - Calls pretending to be support staff
   - "We detected suspicious activity, please confirm your password"

**Why Tech Can't Fix It:**
- ‚úÖ MFA helps, but if someone convinces a user to share their TOTP code, they're in
- ‚úÖ Email verification helps, but users can be tricked into clicking malicious links
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting helps, but social engineering bypasses technical controls

**Mitigation Strategies (Non-Technical):**
1. **Security Awareness Training**
   - In-app tutorials on phishing recognition
   - Regular security tips in notifications
   - "Never share your 2FA code with anyone, including support"
2. **Verified Communication Channels**
   - Official support only contacts via in-app messages
   - Display warnings: "We will NEVER ask for your password"
3. **Community Education**
   - Union leaders educate members on common scams
   - Share examples of phishing attempts
4. **Incident Response Plan**
   - How to report suspicious contact
   - Quick account recovery process

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Add "Security Tips" section to Settings screen
- Show warning banners on sensitive actions
- Provide clear contact info for real support

---

### 12. Insider Threats üü£ AWARENESS ONLY
**Priority:** Awareness Only | **Cannot Be Fully Prevented**

**Why this persists:** Admins/moderators NEED elevated privileges to do their jobs. You can't fully lock them out without breaking core functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Data Exfiltration** - Admin exports all member data and leaks it
   - Email list shared with opposition
   - Vote records leaked to targeted companies
2. **Content Sabotage** - Moderator deletes critical organizing content
   - Delete debate history before important vote
   - Remove key proposals during campaign
3. **Infiltration** - Bad actor joins as trusted member, becomes admin
   - Gains trust over months
   - Sabotages campaigns from inside
4. **Strategy Leaks** - Admin shares internal organizing plans
   - Negotiation terms leaked before meetings
   - Strike timing shared with employer

**Why Tech Can't Fix It:**
- ‚úÖ Audit logs help (you have comprehensive logging), but damage occurs before detection
- ‚úÖ RLS policies help, but admins need bypass capabilities for moderation
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting helps, but admins have legitimate reasons for bulk actions

**Mitigation Strategies (Non-Technical):**
1. **Admin Vetting Process**
   - Require real-world trust (union members, known organizers)
   - Time-based promotion (must be member for 6+ months)
   - Background checks for high-sensitivity unions
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Multiple admin tiers (moderator < admin < super admin)
   - Only super admins can export member data
   - Require 2+ admins to approve critical actions
3. **Audit Log Transparency**
   - All members can see moderation actions (you have this!)
   - Public accountability for admin decisions
   - Regular audit reviews by union members
4. **Separation of Duties**
   - Different admins handle moderation vs data access
   - Rotating admin roles
5. **Offline Trust Networks**
   - Admins must be known in real-world organizing
   - Physical meetings to verify identity

**Current Protections:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit logging (all admin actions tracked)
- ‚úÖ Union member visibility into moderation logs
- ‚úÖ Database triggers track content deletion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No multi-admin approval system yet

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Add admin tier system (multiple permission levels)
- Add "Require 2 admins for data export" feature
- Add "Admin activity dashboard" for transparency

### 13. Supply Chain Attacks üü£ AWARENESS ONLY
**Priority:** Awareness Only | **Requires Infrastructure Migration**

**Why this persists:** Your app depends on 50+ npm packages, Expo build servers, and Supabase cloud. If any get compromised, ALL your security is bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

#### **Level 1: Malicious npm Package** üî¥
If a popular package like `react-native-pager-view` gets hijacked:

**Data Compromised:**
1. **Authentication Tokens**
   - Supabase JWT tokens (stored in expo-secure-store)
   - Session data
   - **Impact:** Attacker impersonates ANY user
2. **User Input in Real-Time**
   - Every keystroke as users type passwords
   - Private debate messages BEFORE encryption
   - Proposal text before sanitization
   - **Impact:** Full visibility into all user activity
3. **Local App State**
   - Current profile (name, email, union memberships)
   - Vote history cached locally
   - Draft proposals not yet submitted
   - **Impact:** Track individual organizers
4. **Device Information**
   - Device ID (your vote tracking system!)
   - IP address, location data
   - **Impact:** Physical tracking of activists

#### **Level 2: Supabase Breach** üî¥üî¥
If Supabase infrastructure is compromised:

**Entire Database Exposed:**
1. **Identity Data**
   - All emails (verified and unverified)
   - Hashed passwords (bcrypt, but still targetable)
   - Phone numbers (if SMS verification added)
   - Real names vs pseudonyms
2. **Political Activity**
   - Every union membership
   - Every vote on every proposal
   - Every debate comment ever made
   - Every politician/company tracked
   - Every boycott/strike proposal
3. **Organizing Intelligence**
   - Most active unions and campaigns
   - Campaigns near activation (98% threshold)
   - Internal strategy discussions
   - Negotiation terms and demands
4. **Relationship Networks**
   - Who votes with whom (organizing patterns)
   - Union admin hierarchies
   - Cross-union collaboration
5. **Audit Trails**
   - Login times and patterns
   - Device fingerprints
   - Geolocation data (city/country from IPs)
   - All moderation actions

#### **Level 3: Expo Build Servers Compromised** üî¥üî¥üî¥
If Expo's infrastructure is hacked:

**Code Injection Attacks:**
1. **Backdoored App Builds**
   - Keylogger injected into production iOS/Android builds
   - Data exfiltration code added silently
   - Users download "official" app from App Store with malware
2. **Build Secrets Stolen**
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - Database credentials
   - All API keys for third-party services
3. **Long-Term Surveillance**
   - Malicious code persists across updates
   - Extremely hard to detect (looks legitimate)

**Real-World Consequences:**
- **Organizers Doxxed:** Full member lists leaked to employers ‚Üí mass firings
- **Campaigns Sabotaged:** Attackers see 98% boycott threshold ‚Üí create fake accounts to vote "No"
- **Government Surveillance:** Police/intelligence buy leaked data ‚Üí track activists via device IDs
- **Chilling Effect:** Trust destroyed, users stop organizing, movement loses critical tool

**Why Tech Can't Fix It:**
- ‚úÖ MFA doesn't help (malware steals tokens AFTER login)
- ‚úÖ E2E encryption doesn't help (malware sees plaintext BEFORE encryption)
- ‚úÖ Privacy controls don't help (attacker has database access)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting doesn't help (not an API attack)
- **The attacker IS your app**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Short-Term (Current Infrastructure):**
1. **Dependency Pinning & Auditing**
   - Lock package versions, audit before upgrading
   - Use `npm audit` and Snyk/Dependabot
   - Review dependency changes in pull requests
2. **Subresource Integrity**
   - Verify package checksums
   - Use lockfiles (package-lock.json)
3. **Bug Bounty Program**
   - Pay security researchers to find issues first
   - Reward responsible disclosure
4. **Incident Response Plan**
   - How to notify users if breach occurs
   - Data breach communication templates
   - Account recovery procedures
5. **Zero-Trust Architecture**
   - Assume any service could be compromised
   - Monitor for anomalous behavior
   - Defense in depth

**Long-Term (Infrastructure Migration):**
See **Section 14: Self-Hosting Infrastructure Transition** below for complete guide on migrating to self-hosted infrastructure to eliminate third-party supply chain risks.

### 14. Physical Device Compromise üü£ AWARENESS ONLY
**Priority:** Awareness Only | **Cannot Be Fully Prevented**

**Why this persists:** Mobile devices can be lost, stolen, or confiscated. Once attacker has physical access, many protections can be bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Police Seizure During Protests**
   - Phone confiscated at rally/demonstration
   - Forensic extraction of app data
   - Organizer identity revealed
2. **Stolen Devices**
   - Phone stolen at public event
   - App still logged in (no auto-logout)
   - Attacker accesses union data
3. **Employer Confiscation**
   - Workplace phone search
   - Work phone used for organizing
   - Employer sees union activity
4. **Border/Checkpoint Searches**
   - International travel with phone
   - Forced unlock at border
   - Political activity visible

**Why Tech Can't Fix It:**
- ‚úÖ expo-secure-store helps (hardware-backed encryption)
- ‚úÖ Auto-logout helps (reduce exposure window)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But if device unlocked, attacker has full access

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Technical (Partial Protection):**
1. **Auto-Logout/Session Timeout**
   - Log out after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - Require biometric re-auth for sensitive actions
   - You already have session timeout!
2. **Biometric App Lock**
   - Require Face ID/fingerprint to open app
   - Even if device unlocked
3. **Remote Wipe Capability**
   - User can remotely log out all sessions
   - Clear local data from lost device
4. **Panic Button**
   - Quick "wipe my data" button
   - For use before confiscation

**Non-Technical (User Education):**
1. **Security Best Practices**
   - Don't use work devices for organizing
   - Enable device encryption
   - Use strong device passcodes (not biometrics for high-risk situations)
2. **Offline Organizing**
   - Don't store sensitive strategy on phones
   - Use encrypted messaging for critical comms
3. **Burner Devices**
   - Disposable phones for high-risk organizing
   - Separate device for protests
4. **Legal Rights Education**
   - Know your rights during searches
   - When you can refuse device unlock

**Current Protections:**
- ‚úÖ Session timeouts (15 min inactivity)
- ‚úÖ Hardware-backed token storage (expo-secure-store)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No biometric app lock yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No remote session management yet

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Add biometric app lock toggle in Settings
- Add "Remote logout all sessions" button
- Add "Security tips for protests" guide

## üèóÔ∏è Self-Hosting Infrastructure Transition (Ultimate Supply Chain Mitigation)

**Priority:** Awareness Only | **Eliminates Third-Party Risks** | **Effort:** Very High

For organizations requiring **complete data sovereignty** and elimination of supply chain risks from Expo/Supabase, here's the self-hosting path:

---

### **Why Self-Host?**

‚úÖ **Eliminates Supply Chain Risks:**
- No dependency on Expo servers (build your own)
- No dependency on Supabase cloud (run your own Postgres)
- Full control over infrastructure and secrets

‚úÖ **Data Sovereignty:**
- Complete control over where data lives
- No third-party access to organizing intelligence
- Compliance with strict regulations

‚ùå **Trade-offs:**
- Requires DevOps expertise (server management, security patches)
- Higher time investment (weeks of setup vs minutes)
- Responsibility for uptime, backups, scaling

---

### **Self-Hosting Cost Comparison**

| Service | Managed (Current) | Self-Hosted | Savings |
|---------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Supabase** | $25-410/month | $10-54/month (VPS) | $200-400/month |
| **Expo Builds** | $29+/month (EAS) | $0 (local builds) | $29+/month |
| **Total** | $100-800/month | $50-150/month | $250-650/month |

**BUT:** Add $500-2,000/month for DevOps personnel if you don't have in-house expertise.

---

### **Supabase Self-Hosting**

#### **Infrastructure Requirements:**
- **Minimum:** 2GB RAM / 1 vCPU (~$10/month DigitalOcean)
- **Production:** 8 vCPU / 32GB RAM (~$54/month Hetzner)

#### **Setup (Docker Compose):**
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase
cd supabase/docker
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with secure secrets
docker compose up -d
```

#### **Required Services:**
- PostgreSQL (database) - 1-2GB RAM
- PostgREST (REST API) - 0.5GB RAM
- GoTrue (authentication) - 0.5GB RAM
- Kong (API gateway) - 0.5GB RAM
- Realtime (WebSocket) - 0.5GB RAM
- Storage (file uploads) - 1GB RAM

**Total:** 4-6GB RAM minimum for production

#### **Security Hardening:**
```bash
# Generate secure secrets
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Update .env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
JWT_SECRET=<generate-above>
ANON_KEY=<generate-at-supabase-docs>
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<generate>
SITE_URL=https://yourapp.com
```

- Firewall: Restrict port 5432 (Postgres) to internal network only
- SSL: Use Nginx + Certbot for HTTPS
- Backups: Automate Postgres dumps to off-server storage

#### **Resources:**
- Official guide: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting
- Docker setup: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker
- Coolify (1-click): https://coolify.io

---

### **React Native Build Alternatives (Expo Replacement)**

#### **Option 1: React Native CLI (Full Control)**
**Eliminates:** Expo build server dependency

**Setup:**
```bash
# Eject from Expo
npx expo prebuild

# Build locally
# iOS: Open ios/ folder in Xcode, build
# Android: Open android/ folder in Android Studio, build
```

**Tools Needed:**
- iOS: Xcode, CocoaPods, Fastlane
- Android: Android Studio, Gradle, JDK

**Deployment Pipeline:**
1. Local builds (Xcode/Android Studio)
2. Fastlane (automation for signing, TestFlight, Play Store upload)
3. Jenkins or GitHub Actions (CI/CD with self-hosted runners)
4. Self-hosted CodePush Server (OTA updates)

---

#### **Option 2: Self-Hosted CI/CD**

**Jenkins (100% Self-Hosted):**
- Run on your own hardware
- No cloud dependency
- Free and open-source
- Requires infrastructure maintenance

**GitHub Actions (Self-Hosted Runners):**
- Free tier for personal projects
- Run builds on your infrastructure
- Easy integration with GitHub repos

**Fastlane (Local Automation):**
```ruby
# Fastfile
lane :beta do
  increment_build_number
  build_app
  upload_to_testflight
end
```

---

#### **Option 3: Self-Hosted CodePush**
**For OTA updates without Expo:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push
- Self-hosted server: https://github.com/htdcx/code-push-server-go
- Push JS bundle updates without app store review

**Note:** Microsoft App Center (hosted CodePush) retires March 31, 2025 - self-hosting is the future.

---

### **Complete Self-Hosted Stack**

```
Your Infrastructure
    ‚Üì
Supabase (self-hosted Docker) - Database, Auth, Realtime
    ‚Üì
React Native CLI - No Expo dependency
    ‚Üì
Local Builds (Xcode/Android Studio)
    ‚Üì
Fastlane - Automation
    ‚Üì
Jenkins/GitHub Actions (self-hosted runners) - CI/CD
    ‚Üì
Self-hosted CodePush - OTA updates
    ‚Üì
App Store / Play Store
```

---

### **When to Self-Host?**

#### ‚úÖ **Good Fit:**
- High-security requirements (government surveillance risk)
- Compliance requirements (data must stay in specific location)
- Budget constraints (>$250/month savings)
- Team has DevOps expertise
- Predictable traffic patterns
- Long-term commitment (years, not months)

#### ‚ùå **Stick with Managed Services:**
- Fast time-to-market (launch in weeks, not months)
- No DevOps resources
- Unpredictable traffic spikes (need auto-scaling)
- Small team focused on features
- Early-stage MVP (validate first, optimize later)

---

### **Migration Timeline**

**Phase 1: Planning (2 weeks)**
- Audit current Supabase usage
- Plan infrastructure requirements
- Set up VPS/cloud server
- Team training on Docker/DevOps

**Phase 2: Backend Migration (3-4 weeks)**
- Deploy self-hosted Supabase
- Migrate database (PostgreSQL dump ‚Üí restore)
- Test all API endpoints
- Update app to point to new backend URL

**Phase 3: Build Pipeline (2-3 weeks)**
- Set up React Native CLI project
- Configure Fastlane automation
- Set up CI/CD (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)
- Test iOS and Android builds

**Phase 4: Rollout (1-2 weeks)**
- Deploy new app version pointing to self-hosted backend
- Monitor for issues
- Gradually migrate users
- Decommission Supabase cloud

**Total:** 8-11 weeks + ongoing maintenance

---

### **Bottom Line: Self-Hosting Decision Matrix**

| Factor | Managed (Current) | Self-Hosted |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Cost (infrastructure)** | $100-800/mo | $50-150/mo |
| **Cost (DevOps)** | $0 | $500-2,000/mo (if hiring) |
| **Setup time** | Minutes | 2-3 months |
| **Security control** | Limited | Complete |
| **Supply chain risk** | High | Low |
| **Time to market** | Fast | Slow |
| **Recommended for** | MVP, early stage | Mature, high-security needs |

**Recommendation:** Stay on managed services for MVP launch. Migrate to self-hosted infrastructure only when:
1. You have proven product-market fit
2. You have DevOps expertise in-house
3. You face genuine security threats (targeted attacks, government surveillance)
4. You have 6+ months for migration
