# ‚úÖ GDPR Article 17 Auth Deletion - COMPLETE

**Status**: Production-ready  
**Architect Review**: PASSED  
**Date Completed**: October 17, 2025

## What We Built

A complete GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure) implementation that deletes `auth.users` records within 30 days of account deletion request.

### The Challenge

Client applications cannot directly delete `auth.users` records because this requires service-role permissions that only backend systems have access to.

### The Solution

**Two-Phase Deletion System**:

1. **Immediate Phase** (Client-triggered):
   - User clicks "Delete My Account" ‚Üí `hard_delete_user_account()` function runs
   - ‚úÖ Deletes all application data (50+ tables)
   - ‚úÖ Anonymizes audit logs (user_id nullified, username scrubbed)
   - ‚úÖ Logs deletion request to `user_deletion_requests` table
   - ‚úÖ Shows user: "Your data is deleted. Auth credentials will be removed within 30 days."

2. **Delayed Phase** (Automated backend):
   - ‚è∞ Edge Function runs daily (scheduled via cron)
   - ‚úÖ Queries `user_deletion_requests` for pending deletions
   - ‚úÖ Uses service-role key to delete `auth.users` records
   - ‚úÖ Marks deletion requests as completed with timestamps
   - ‚úÖ Retry logic handles transient failures (max 5 retries)

## Files Created

### SQL Migration
- **`voter-unions/supabase/deletion-tracking.sql`**
  - Creates `user_deletion_requests` tracking table
  - Updates `hard_delete_user_account()` to log deletion requests
  - Adds `get_deletion_request_status()` for user queries
  - RLS policies for user access to their deletion status

### Edge Function
- **`voter-unions/supabase/functions/cleanup-deleted-users/index.ts`**
  - Deno Edge Function with service-role permissions
  - Batch processing (100 deletions per run)
  - Retry logic with error handling
  - Comprehensive logging

- **`voter-unions/supabase/functions/cleanup-deleted-users/deno.json`**
  - Deno configuration for imports

### Documentation
- **`voter-unions/supabase/functions/cleanup-deleted-users/README.md`**
  - Edge Function documentation
  - How it works
  - Monitoring queries
  - Testing procedures

- **`voter-unions/supabase/EDGE_FUNCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`**
  - Complete deployment guide
  - Two cron options (external service vs pg_cron)
  - Step-by-step testing procedures
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Production checklist

## Deployment Instructions

üëâ **See**: [`EDGE_FUNCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`](./EDGE_FUNCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Quick Summary**:

1. **Run SQL migration** (in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor):
   ```bash
   # Copy and paste contents of deletion-tracking.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Edge Function**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy cleanup-deleted-users
   ```

3. **Set up cron scheduling** (choose one):
   - **Option A**: External cron service (Cron-job.org) - Recommended
   - **Option B**: Database pg_cron - Advanced

**Estimated Setup Time**: 15-20 minutes

## How Users Experience It

### 1. User Requests Deletion

```typescript
// In ProfileScreen.tsx
const { mutate: deleteAccount } = useDeleteAccount();

deleteAccount(); // User clicks "Delete My Account"
```

### 2. User Sees Confirmation

```
‚úÖ Account deleted successfully

Your data has been removed from our systems.

Note: For security reasons, your authentication 
credentials will be permanently removed by our 
backend systems within 30 days.
```

### 3. User Can Check Status

```typescript
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_deletion_request_status');

console.log(data);
// {
//   has_deletion_request: true,
//   requested_at: "2025-10-17T10:30:00Z",
//   completed: false,
//   days_since_request: 2,
//   auth_user_deleted: false
// }
```

### 4. Backend Completes Deletion

- ‚è∞ Daily at 2 AM UTC, Edge Function runs
- üóëÔ∏è Deletes `auth.users` record
- ‚úÖ Marks request as completed
- üìä Logs completion timestamp

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Pending Deletions

```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  username,
  requested_at,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM NOW() - requested_at) as days_pending
FROM user_deletion_requests
WHERE completed_at IS NULL
ORDER BY requested_at;
```

### View Edge Function Logs

In Supabase Dashboard:
- Navigate to **Edge Functions** ‚Üí **cleanup-deleted-users**
- Click **Logs** tab
- View execution history and any errors

### Deletion Statistics

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completed_at IS NULL) as pending,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL) as completed,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - requested_at)) / 3600)::int as avg_hours
FROM user_deletion_requests;
```
